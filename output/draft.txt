## Key points (required)

* Understand how to prevent the flu to protect yourself and others.
  * Flu vaccines are the first line of defense against the influenza virus.
  * Everyone 6 months of age and older should get vaccinated annually.

## Overview

The flu, or influenza, is a respiratory illness that can cause mild to severe symptoms and can even be life-threatening. It is highly contagious and spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, and fatigue. The best prevention method is getting a yearly flu vaccine, which is recommended by the CDC for everyone over the age of 6 months. Additionally, everyday preventive actions can help stop the spread of the flu virus.

## Exposure

Exposure to the flu virus can occur when you come into contact with an infected person or a contaminated surface. The virus can enter your body when you touch your face with unwashed hands or through the inhalation of airborne droplets. People at higher risk of severe flu complications include young children, pregnant individuals, those with chronic health conditions, and the elderly. Health care workers and caregivers for high-risk individuals should also take extra precautions to prevent spreading the flu.

## Prevention Methods and Options

* **Getting Vaccinated:** A flu vaccine is the most effective way to protect against the flu. It reduces the risk of illness, hospitalizations, and severe outcomes. Ideally, get vaccinated by the end of October, but vaccination should continue throughout flu season.
  * **Everyday Preventive Actions:** To reduce the spread of germs, avoid close contact with sick individuals, stay home when you are sick, cover coughs and sneezes, wash your hands frequently, and clean surfaces regularly.
  * **Antiviral Drugs:** If you get the flu, antiviral drugs may be prescribed by your doctor. These can make the illness milder and prevent serious complications, especially if started within two days of becoming sick.

## Making a Plan

Plan to get your flu vaccine each year, and encourage friends and family to do the same. Keep hand sanitizer with you for times when soap and water aren't available, and maintain a clean environment at home and work.

## Why Itâ€™s Important

Getting vaccinated not only protects you from the flu but also helps protect the community by reducing the spread of the virus. It's particularly important to prevent serious illness in those who are at higher risk.

## Treatment

If you contract the flu, consult your healthcare provider as soon as possible. They may prescribe antiviral drugs to help you recover more quickly and reduce the risk of complications.

## Reporting

If you suspect an outbreak of the flu in your community, report it to your local health department to help them monitor and control the spread of the virus.

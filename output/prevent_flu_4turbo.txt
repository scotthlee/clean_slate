## Page title: Preventing Influenza (Flu)

## Key points

* Influenza is a serious respiratory illness that can lead to severe complications, especially in certain high-risk groups.
* Vaccination is the most effective method for preventing the flu and reducing the severity of illness.
* Understanding how the flu spreads and who is most at risk can help in taking the right preventive actions.

## Overview

Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, and the illness can result in hospitalization or even death. The flu spreads mainly through droplets from coughs and sneezes. The best way to protect against the flu is by getting vaccinated each year. Additionally, everyday preventive actions can help slow the spread of germs.

## Exposure

The flu is transmitted primarily by droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of nearby people or be inhaled into the lungs. Less commonly, a person might become infected by touching a surface with the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes. People can spread the flu before they know they are sick and while they are symptomatic.

## What CDC is doing

The CDC conducts annual studies to monitor the incidence of flu infections and provides recommendations for the seasonal flu vaccine composition. The CDC also offers resources to educate the public on flu prevention and treatment, and it supports the development of flu antiviral medications.

## Resources

You can find a flu vaccine near you by using the [Flu Vaccine Finder](https://vaccinefinder.org/).

### Reminder: Getting Vaccinated

It's important to get a flu vaccine every year. The vaccine is designed to protect against the most common flu viruses for the season. Everyone 6 months and older should aim to get vaccinated by the end of October, but vaccinations should continue to be offered as long as the flu virus is circulating.

### Additional prevention methods:

* Avoid close contact with sick individuals.
* If you are sick, limit your contact with others to prevent spreading the illness.
* Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.
* Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
* Regularly clean and disinfect potentially contaminated surfaces.
* Improve indoor air quality to reduce the concentration of airborne viruses.

### Treatment

If you contract the flu, antiviral drugs may be a treatment option. Consult with your healthcare provider as soon as flu symptoms appear, especially if you are at higher risk of flu complications. Antiviral treatment is most effective when started within the first two days of symptom onset.

## Preventing the Flu

**Key points:**

- The flu vaccine is the most important preventive action to reduce the risk of flu and its serious outcomes.
- Other preventive actions include avoiding close contact with sick individuals, covering coughs and sneezes, practicing good hand hygiene, and cleaning/disinfecting surfaces.
- Antiviral drugs can be used to treat the flu if prescribed by a doctor.

**Overview:**

The flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. It can lead to mild to severe illness and sometimes even death. The best way to prevent the flu is by getting a flu vaccine every year. In addition to vaccination, there are several preventive actions you can take to reduce the spread of flu viruses.

**Exposure:**

The flu virus spreads mainly through droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people nearby, or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. You can also get the flu by touching a surface or object that has the flu virus on it and then touching your own mouth, nose, or eyes.

**Risk factors:**

Certain individuals are at higher risk of developing serious complications from the flu. This includes young children, pregnant people, those with chronic health conditions like asthma, diabetes, or heart and lung disease, and people 65 years and older. Health care workers and those who live or care for people at higher risk are also at increased risk of getting the flu.

**Prevention steps and strategies:**

1. Get a flu vaccine: The flu vaccine is recommended for everyone 6 months and older. It is designed to protect against four flu viruses and can reduce the severity of illness in vaccinated individuals. Ideally, get vaccinated by the end of October, but continue to get vaccinated as long as flu viruses are circulating.

2. Take everyday preventive actions:
   - Avoid close contact with sick people.
   - If you are sick, stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone (except for medical care or necessities).
   - Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your elbow, and dispose of tissues properly.
   - Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
   - Avoid touching your face, especially your eyes, nose, and mouth.
   - Clean and disinfect frequently-touched surfaces and objects, especially if they may be contaminated with flu viruses.

3. Take flu antiviral drugs if prescribed: If you become sick with the flu, antiviral drugs can be used to treat the illness. These prescription medicines can make the illness milder, shorten the duration of sickness, and prevent serious complications. It's best to start antiviral treatment within 2 days of getting sick, but it can still be helpful even if started later.

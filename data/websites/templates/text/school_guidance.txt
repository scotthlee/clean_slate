## Template Guidance

and staff around a disease, condition, or health topic.

Can also include:

* Background
  * Why it’s important
  * Guidance or strategies
  * Guidance and training for specific roles
  * Resources

**Usage tips:**

* Select the sections that are most relevant to your communication needs.
  * Use the “Keep reading” component for longer sections so the page stays scannable, while allowing readers to see more information if they choose to.
  * Within each section, you can add custom H3s and H4s to break information apart by category or idea.
  * Use bullets whenever possible to organize ideas and make the page easy to read.
  * Add your own callouts or select from suggested callouts. These can highlight key information in a section.

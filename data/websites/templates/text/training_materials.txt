## Template Guidance

**Primary goal:** House training modules, detailed course information, course
materials, and other supplementary training information.

**Can also include:**

* Up to 15 custom headings
  * Subheadings
  * Callouts
  * Other components

**Usage tips:**

* Keep main headings brief. They’ll appear as links in the “On this page” area so readers can easily navigate between sections.
  * While this template allows up to 15 sections, higher numbers should only be used in special circumstances. Keep readability best practices in mind.
  * Use the “Keep reading” component to guide readers to related information.
  * Add your own callouts or select from suggested callouts. These can highlight key information in a section.
  * Use the “Developer Request” component for items like data visualizations, complex tables, and multimedia.
  * Use the “Training Summary” template to provide an overview or introduction to the training.
  * For simply linking to resources and materials, the “Lists and Collections” template may be a better fit.

## Template Guidance

**Primary goal:** Provide standardized infection control guidance for
healthcare settings and other environments.

Can also include:

* Updates
  * Background
  * Recommendation details
  * Evidence and rationale
  * About the recommendations
  * Resources

**Usage tips:**

* Select the sections that are most relevant to your communication needs.
  * Use the “Keep reading” component for longer sections so the page stays scannable, while allowing readers to see more information if they choose to.
  * Within each section, you can add custom H3s and H4s to break information apart by category or idea.
  * Use bullets whenever possible to organize ideas and make the page easy to read.
  * Add your own callouts or select from suggested callouts. These can highlight key information in a section.

## Remember 

[Use callouts for important pieces of information. For Infection Control,
callouts can draw attention to a reminder or key consideration.]

Additional section header option(s):

* Keep in mind
  * Tip
  * Key consideration

## Template Guidance

**Primary goal:** Provide evidence-based professional or general guidance for
urgent scenarios, particularly when recommendations may shift based on the
status of a disease, condition, or event.

Can also include:

* Introduction
  * About the guidance
  * Resources and tools

## Page title : Emergency Response Guidance Template

## **Key points (required)**

* Summary statement 1
  * Summary statement 2
  * Summary statement 3

## Introduction (required)

Establish the problem to be addressed and clearly describe the scope of the guidance (e.g., types of recommendations included, relevant contexts, target audience). Try to limit to 3 brief paragraphs. If a set of important updates needs to be surfaced before guidance is given, add a Callout component under the heading to address them. (Non-urgent updates should be integrated into the “About this guidance” section). Select a label option based on audience and communication need:  
Introduction
Overview
Scope

## Recommendations (required)

Use the “Recommendations” heading if all recommendations fall within a single category. For pages with 2+ categories, use the repeatable “Recommendations for [description]” heading.

  * Use the “Keep reading” component for longer sections so the page stays scannable, while allowing readers to see more information if they choose to.
  * Within each section, you can add custom H3s and H4s to break information apart by category or idea.
  * Use bullets whenever possible to organize ideas and make the page easy to read.
  * Add your own callouts or select from suggested callouts. These can highlight key information in a section.

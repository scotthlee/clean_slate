## Template Guidance

**Primary goal:** List information for healthcare providers about how the
disease appears in the general public and special populations.

Can also include information on:

* Clinical presentation
  * Common signs and symptoms
  * Images
  * Clinical assessment
  * Complications
  * Lab testing guidance
  * Next steps

**Usage tips:**

* Select the sections that are most relevant to your communication needs.
  * Use the “Keep reading” component for longer sections so the page stays scannable, while allowing readers to see more information if they choose to.
  * Within each section, you can add custom H3s and H4s to break information apart by category or idea.
  * Use bullets whenever possible to organize ideas and make the page easy to read.
  * Add your own callouts or select from suggested callouts. These can highlight key information in a section.

in an urgent situation.]

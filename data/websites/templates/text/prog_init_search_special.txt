## Template Guidance

**Primary goal:** Provide supplementary information about programs,
initiatives, and research efforts (such as policy information, specific
program activities and decision-making frameworks, or meeting details).

Can also include:

* An overview or background information
  * Top things to know
  * Process/steps
  * Evaluation and strategy
  * Meeting information
  * Q&A
  * Contacts
  * Resources and tools

**Usage tips:**

* Select the sections that are most relevant to your communication needs.
  * Use the “Keep reading” component for longer sections so the page stays scannable, while allowing readers to see more information if they choose to.
  * Within each section, you can add custom H3s and H4s to break information apart by category or idea.
  * Use bullets whenever possible to organize ideas and make the page easy to read.
  * Add your own callouts or select from suggested callouts. These can highlight key information in a section.

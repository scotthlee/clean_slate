## Template Guidance

**Primary goal:** Provide focus on a sub-topic that branches from an existing
health or safety topic.

Can also include:

* Background
  * Terms
  * Facts
  * Risks
  * Impacts
  * Recommendations
  * How research relates to the topic
  * Actions to take
  * Resources

**Usage tips:**

* Select the sections that are most relevant to your communication needs.
  * Use the “Keep reading” component for longer sections so the page stays scannable, while allowing readers to see more information if they choose to.
  * Within each section, you can add custom H3s and H4s to break information apart by category or idea.
  * Use bullets whenever possible to organize ideas and make the page easy to read.
  * Add your own callouts or select from suggested callouts. These can highlight key information in a section.

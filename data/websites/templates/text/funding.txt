## Template Guidance

**Primary goal:** Describe how programs, initiatives, projects, and CIOs are
funded and highlight funding opportunities.

Can include:

* Overview
  * Background
  * Funding by state
  * Current funding opportunities
  * Priorities
  * Activities
  * Recipients
  * Data
  * Policy
  * Funding over time
  * Other projects

**Usage tips:**

* Select the sections that are most relevant to your communication needs.
  * Use the “Keep reading” component for longer sections so the page stays scannable, while allowing readers to see more information if they choose to.
  * Within each section, you can add custom H3s and H4s to break information apart by category or idea.
  * Use bullets whenever possible to organize ideas and make the page easy to read.
  * Add your own callouts or select from suggested callouts. These can highlight key information in a section.

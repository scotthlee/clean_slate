tests.

Can also include information on:

* How the lab supports public health
  * Lab services offered
  * Test methods
  * Laboratory guidelines
  * Collecting and sending specimens
  * Interpreting and reporting results
  * Partnerships

## **Keep in mind (optional callout for any section)**

[Use callouts to draw attention to pieces of information. For Lab Information
and Testing Procedures, callouts can highlight a guideline or key
consideration. You can either choose from “suggested” callouts or create your
own.]

Additional section header option(s):

* Important guideline
  * Important consideration
  * Important

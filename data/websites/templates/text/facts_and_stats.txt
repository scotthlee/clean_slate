## Template Guidance

**Primary goal:** Provide an organized and structured way to view important
facts and/or statistics related to a topic.

Can also include information on:

* An introduction
  * Highlights
  * Latest trends
  * Challenges
  * Populations
  * Impact
  * Prevention
  * What’s being done
  * Next steps
  * Common questions
  * Data sources
  * Resources

**Usage tips:**

* Be sure to include meaningful captions when presenting infographs.
  * For data tables or data visualizations, use the “Developer Request” component.
  * Select the sections that are most relevant to your communication needs. Some “Facts and Stats” pages will only use 2-3 sections, while others may use most of the available sections.
  * Use the “Keep reading” component for longer sections so the page stays scannable, while allowing readers to see more information if they choose to.
  * Within each section, you can add custom H3s and H4s to break information apart by category or idea.
  * Use bullets whenever possible to organize ideas and make the page easy to read.
  * Add your own callouts or select from suggested callouts. These can highlight key information in a section.

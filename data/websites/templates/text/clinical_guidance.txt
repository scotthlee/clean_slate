## Template Guidance

**Primary goal:** Cover core guidance content for healthcare professionals,
including guiding principles and recommendations.  
Can also include information on:

* Guiding principles
  * Recommendations
  * How to recognize disease/condition
  * Determining whether to prescribe medicine
  * Understanding complications
  * Management of disease/condition
  * Management of disease/condition in specific populations
  * Mitigating/Assessing risk

**Usage tips:**

* This Content Type can be used to 1) provide a set of recommendations; 2) provide a summary of how to diagnose, treat, and manage a disease or condition; 3) a combination of these.
  * Consider breaking more background-focused information into a “Clinical Overview” page and more actionable information into a “Clinical Guidance” page.
  * Select the sections that are most relevant to your communication needs.
  * Use the “Keep reading” component for longer sections so the page stays scannable, while allowing readers to see more information if they choose to.
  * Within each section, you can add custom H3s and H4s to break information apart by category or idea.
  * Use bullets whenever possible to organize ideas and make the page easy to read.
  * Add your own callouts or select from suggested callouts. These can highlight key information in a section.

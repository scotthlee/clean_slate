## Template Guidance

**Primary goal:** Provide an overview of a campaign’s purpose and impact.

Can also include:

* Why it’s needed
  * Who it’s for
  * Goals
  * Funding
  * How success is measured
  * How it was formed
  * Reactions
  * What’s next
  * Resources

**Usage tips:**

* Select the sections that are most relevant to your communication needs.
  * Use the “”Keep reading”” component for longer sections so the page stays scannable, while allowing readers to see more information if they choose to.
  * Within each section, you can add custom H3s and H4s to break information apart by category or idea.
  * Use bullets whenever possible to organize ideas and make the page easy to read.
  * Add your own callouts or select from suggested callouts. These can highlight key information in a section.

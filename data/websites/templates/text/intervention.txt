or category of interventions.

  * Goals
  * Core
  * Elements
  * Evidence of impact
  * Implementation guidance and materials
  * Training
  * Resources

**Usage tips:**

* Select the sections that are most relevant to your communication needs.
  * Use the “Keep reading” component for longer sections so the page stays scannable, while allowing readers to see more information if they choose to.
  * Within each section, you can add custom H3s and H4s to break information apart by category or idea.
  * Use bullets whenever possible to organize ideas and make the page easy to read.
  * Add your own callouts or select from suggested callouts. These can highlight key information in a section.

## Tip 

[Use callouts for tips, facts, or important pieces of information. They can
also be used to link to a success story or resource. These callouts can be
placed in any section.]

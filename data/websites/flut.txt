### [Take time to get a flu
vaccine.](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/index.html)

  * CDC recommends a yearly flu vaccine as the first and most important action in reducing your risk of flu and its potentially serious outcomes.
  * Flu vaccines help to reduce the burden of flu illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths on the health care system each year. (Read more about [flu vaccine benefits](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine-benefits.htm).)
  * Flu vaccination also has been shown to reduce the severity of illness in people who get vaccinated but still get sick.
  * This season, all flu vaccines are designed to protect against four flu viruses. (Visit [Vaccine Virus Selection](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine-selection.htm) for this season’s vaccine composition.)
  * Everyone 6 months and older should get an annual flu vaccine, ideally by the end of October but people should continue to get vaccinated as long as flu viruses pose a threat to their community.
  * Vaccination of people at higher risk of developing serious flu complications is especially important to decrease their risk of severe flu illness.
  * [People at higher risk of serious flu complications](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/index.htm) include [young children](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/children.htm), [pregnant people](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/pregnant.htm), people with certain chronic health conditions like [asthma](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/asthma.htm), [diabetes](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/diabetes.htm) or [heart](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/heartdisease.htm) and lung disease, and [people 65 years and older](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/65over.htm).
  * Vaccination also is important for [health care workers](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/vaccination/index.htm), and other people who live with or care for people at higher risk to keep from spreading flu to them. This is especially true for people who work in long-term care facilities, which are home to many of the people most vulnerable to flu.
  * [Children younger than 6 months](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/parents.htm) are at higher risk of serious flu illness but are too young to be vaccinated. People who care for infants should be vaccinated instead.

### [Take everyday preventive actions to stop the spread of
germs.](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/actions-prevent-flu.htm)

  * Take other preventive actions in addition to vaccination that may help reduce the spread of viruses like flu. 
    * Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
    * If you are sick, limit contact with others as much as possible to keep from infecting them. For [flu](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/treatment/caring-for-someone.htm), CDC recommends that people stay home for at least 24 hours after their fever is gone except to get medical care or other necessities. Fever should be gone without the need to use a fever-reducing medicine.
  * Cover coughs and sneezes. 
    * Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.
    * Masks also can help reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. People who are sick might be asked to wear a mask to protect others, but a mask can protect the wearer too. This might be especially important if you are at higher risk of developing serious complications from flu.
  * [Wash your hands](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/) often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.
  * Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Germs spread this way.
  * Clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with viruses that cause flu.
  * Virus in the air can spread between people more easily indoors than outdoors. Improving air quality, such as opening windows or using air purifiers, can help reduce the amount of virus you are exposed to.

### [Take flu antiviral drugs if your doctor prescribes
them.](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/treatment/index.html)

  * If you are sick with flu, antiviral drugs can be used to treat your illness.
  * Antiviral drugs are different from antibiotics. They are prescription medicines (pills, liquid or an inhaled powder) and are not available over-the-counter.
  * Flu antiviral drugs can make flu illness milder and shorten the time you are sick. They may also prevent serious [flu complications](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/symptoms.htm#complications). [For people with higher risk factors [308 KB, 2 Pages]](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pdf/freeresources/updated/treating-influenza.pdf), treatment with an antiviral drug can mean the difference between having a milder illness versus a very serious illness that could result in a hospital stay.
  * Studies show that flu antiviral drugs work best for treatment when they are started within 2 days of getting sick, but starting them later can still be helpful, especially if the sick person has a [higher risk factor](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/index.htm) or is very sick from flu.
  * If you are at higher risk from flu and get flu symptoms, call your health care provider early so you can be treated with flu antivirals if needed. Follow your doctor’s instructions for taking this drug.

Flu symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body
aches, headache, chills and fatigue. Some people also may have vomiting and
diarrhea. People may be infected with flu and have respiratory symptoms
without a fever. Visit CDC’s website to find out [what to do if you get sick
with flu](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/treatment/takingcare.htm). Learn about some
of the [similarities and differences between flu and
COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm), and the
[difference between flu and the common
cold.](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/coldflu.htm)

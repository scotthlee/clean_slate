### Take time to get a flu vaccine. CDC recommends a yearly flu vaccine as the
first and most important action in reducing your risk of flu and its
potentially serious outcomes. Flu vaccines help to reduce the burden of flu
illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths on the health care system each year.
(Read more about flu vaccine benefits.) Flu vaccination also has been shown to
reduce the severity of illness in people who get vaccinated but still get
sick. This season, all flu vaccines are designed to protect against four flu
viruses. (Visit Vaccine Virus Selection for this season’s vaccine
composition.) Everyone 6 months and older should get an annual flu vaccine,
ideally by the end of October but people should continue to get vaccinated as
long as flu viruses pose a threat to their community. Vaccination of people at
higher risk of developing serious flu complications is especially important to
decrease their risk of severe flu illness. People at higher risk of serious
flu complications include young children, pregnant people, people with certain
chronic health conditions like asthma, diabetes or heart and lung disease, and
people 65 years and older. Vaccination also is important for health care
workers, and other people who live with or care for people at higher risk to
keep from spreading flu to them. This is especially true for people who work
in long-term care facilities, which are home to many of the people most
vulnerable to flu. Children younger than 6 months are at higher risk of
serious flu illness but are too young to be vaccinated. People who care for
infants should be vaccinated instead. ### Take everyday preventive actions to
stop the spread of germs. Take other preventive actions in addition to
vaccination that may help reduce the spread of viruses like flu. Avoid close
contact with people who are sick. If you are sick, limit contact with others
as much as possible to keep from infecting them. For flu, CDC recommends that
people stay home for at least 24 hours after their fever is gone except to get
medical care or other necessities. Fever should be gone without the need to
use a fever-reducing medicine. Cover coughs and sneezes. Cover your nose and
mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash
after you use it. Masks also can help reduce the spread of respiratory
viruses. People who are sick might be asked to wear a mask to protect others,
but a mask can protect the wearer too. This might be especially important if
you are at higher risk of developing serious complications from flu. Wash your
hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an
alcohol-based hand rub. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Germs
spread this way. Clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that may be
contaminated with viruses that cause flu. Virus in the air can spread between
people more easily indoors than outdoors. Improving air quality, such as
opening windows or using air purifiers, can help reduce the amount of virus
you are exposed to. Take flu antiviral drugs if your doctor prescribes them.
If you are sick with flu, antiviral drugs can be used to treat your illness.
Antiviral drugs are different from antibiotics. They are prescription
medicines (pills, liquid or an inhaled powder) and are not available over-the-
counter. Flu antiviral drugs can make flu illness milder and shorten the time
you are sick. They may also prevent serious flu complications. For people with
higher risk factors [308 KB, 2 Pages], treatment with an antiviral drug can
mean the difference between having a milder illness versus a very serious
illness that could result in a hospital stay. Studies show that flu antiviral
drugs work best for treatment when they are started within 2 days of getting
sick, but starting them later can still be helpful, especially if the sick
person has a higher risk factor or is very sick from flu. If you are at higher
risk from flu and get flu symptoms, call your health care provider early so
you can be treated with flu antivirals if needed. Follow your doctor’s
instructions for taking this drug. Flu symptoms include fever, cough, sore
throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue. Some
people also may have vomiting and diarrhea. People may be infected with flu
and have respiratory symptoms without a fever. Visit CDC’s website to find out
what to do if you get sick with flu. Learn about some of the similarities and
differences between flu and COVID-19, and the difference between flu and the
common cold. ### Take flu antiviral drugs if your doctor prescribes them. If
